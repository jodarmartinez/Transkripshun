# Transkripshun
Open source transcription software for Linux, Windows, and Mac. Comparable to ExpressScribe. Press F2 to play/pause. Press F4 to rewind 3 seconds.
# Using
You need to install Python3, Pyglet, and Avbin (if you're using any other audio format than WAV). Then you simply run the program as normal and supply your audio file as a commandline argument.
# Notes
The program isn't graphical at all. It simply reads, "hello world" on the screen. I didn't put everything into the project. I just put enough into it to be useful. If you want more features, you can develop them yourself, pay me to develop them, or wait until I add them.
